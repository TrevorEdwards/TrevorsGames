	Welcome to my game site.  Hopefully you are here because I gave you the link, otherwise you shouldn't be here I think.
	Anyway, here are some wonderful games:
	<ul>
		<li><a href = mathcube/index.html>Math Cube</a></li>
		<li><a href = 423/index.html>423</a></li>
		<li><a href = youareadot/index.html>You are a dot</a></li>
	</ul>
	These games are for private use and are not open for public enjoyment.
